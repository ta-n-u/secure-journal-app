# Secure Journal — Encrypted Diary & Habit Tracker

A full-stack MERN application combining a **zero-knowledge encrypted diary** with a **habit tracker** featuring streaks and a GitHub-style consistency heatmap.

## Why this project

Most portfolio CRUD apps look the same. This one is built around a genuine security challenge: **the server never sees your diary entries in plaintext — not even the database admin can read them.** All encryption and decryption happens in the browser using the Web Crypto API.

## Architecture

### Zero-knowledge encryption design
- On signup, each user gets a random `encryptionSalt` (not secret, just unique per user)
- On login, the browser derives an AES-256 key from the user's password + their salt using **PBKDF2** (100,000 iterations, SHA-256)
- Diary entries are encrypted client-side with **AES-GCM** before being sent to the server
- The server only ever stores `ciphertext` + `iv` — it has no way to decrypt entries, even with full database access
- The password itself is separately hashed with bcrypt for authentication — this hash is *not* the encryption key and can't be used to decrypt anything

**Tradeoff, stated honestly:** the derived key is cached in `sessionStorage` (not `localStorage`) so a page refresh doesn't force re-login. This means the key briefly exists in browser storage rather than purely in memory — a deliberate usability-vs-purity tradeoff. The session ends when the browser tab is closed or the user logs out manually.

### Habit tracking
- Users define habits and check in daily
- Current/longest streaks are computed on read by walking sorted check-in dates and measuring consecutive-day gaps — no separate counter to keep in sync
- A calendar heatmap (GitHub contribution graph style) visualizes consistency over the past year

## Tech stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router, Web Crypto API, react-calendar-heatmap, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Atlas), Mongoose
- **Auth:** JWT, bcrypt
